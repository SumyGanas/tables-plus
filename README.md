Enhanced features for obsidian tables

- Table headings can be defined as types 
- Feature 1: Type Rules - Ex. An index type will auto-index the columns excel style, money type = dollar amount, 
- Feature 2: Filtering - Ex. If a type is an enum, you can filter the table to display only the rows with that particular enum
- Usage
    - Right click on the heading to see configuration nested menu
    - Types are listed under configuration 
    - Click on the type to save that value as belonging to that type
    - The rows in that column will follow those type rules
